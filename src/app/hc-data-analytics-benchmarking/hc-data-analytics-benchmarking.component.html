                Utilizing data analytics and benchmarking
                on scattered or surveyed data provides organizations
                 with crucial insights.
                 This approach not only identifies areas
                for improvement but also supports
                evidence-based decision-making.
                 By leveraging diverse data sources,
                scalable data collection methods,
                and cost-effective strategies,
                organizations can actively drive innovation
                 and collaboration within their industries.
                Maintaining high data quality and privacy standards
                 is imperative throughout the process.

                 This could happen over 2 layers:
        – Short-term internal within the organization over time or comparing different parties together.
        – Long-term externally within a peer group either market, sector or based on needed analysis.
        By leveraging data-driven decision-making, individuals can make informed choices, identify opportunities, and address challenges effectively.
